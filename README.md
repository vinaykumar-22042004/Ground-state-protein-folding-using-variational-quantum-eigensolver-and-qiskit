# 🧬 Quantum Protein Folding Simulation with CVaR-VQE

## 🧾 Introduction

Protein folding is a fundamental problem in molecular biology that involves predicting the 3D structure of a protein based solely on its amino acid sequence. This problem is computationally intensive due to the exponential number of possible configurations a protein can assume.

In this project, we explore a **quantum computing approach** to protein folding using **Qiskit** and **CVaR-VQE (Conditional Value at Risk - Variational Quantum Eigensolver)**. The simulation leverages a turn-based representation of the protein sequence, the Miyazawa-Jernigan (MJ) interaction matrix, and a custom quantum ansatz to estimate energetically favorable configurations.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

To run this code on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-protein-folding.git
   cd quantum-protein-folding
2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install qiskit qiskit-aer matplotlib scipy numpy
4. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python protein_folding_vqe.py
5. **Provide a protein sequence input when prompted, for example**:
   ```java
   Enter the protein sequence (e.g., APRLRFY): APRLRFY
## 📝 Notes
* The script runs 8 independent CVaR-VQE optimizations and selects the configuration with the lowest energy.

* A turn-based representation is used where each turn is mapped into qubit configurations (e.g., 00, 01, 10, 11).
  * The energy function includes:
  * Backtracking penalties
  * Distance constraints
  * Local structure constraints

* Output includes:
  * optimal_circuit.png: Quantum circuit visualization
  * cvar_scatter.png: Scatter plot of CVaR energies
  * bitstring_histogram.png: Histogram of frequent measurement outcomes
  * output_summary.txt: Summary of results and interaction matrix

## 📌 Disclaimer
This project is a simulation, and while it explores important ideas in quantum computational biology, it is not currently suited for accurate protein folding prediction in practical scenarios. It aims to demonstrate how quantum variational algorithms could be applied to a simplified model of protein folding.
